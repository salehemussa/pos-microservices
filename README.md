A Point of Sale (POS) system built with Spring Boot 3.5.7, Microservices Architecture, MariaDB, Docker, and JWT Authentication.
This project demonstrates a modular microservice setup for managing Products, Orders, Customers, and Authentication.

Microservices Overview
Service	Port	Description
Discovery Server	8761	Eureka server for service registration
API Gateway	8080	Routes and secures API requests
Auth Service	8081	Handles user registration, login, and JWT token generation

Order Service	8083	Handles customer orders
Customer Service	8084	Manages customer profiles
System Features
Admin

Manage products (Add, Edit, Delete)

Manage customers

View and track orders

Customer

Register and login

Browse available products

Place orders

View personal order history

Every request to Product/Order services passes through the API Gateway

Gateway validates JWT using a shared secret key

Role-based access control (Admin vs Customer)

 Local Setup (Without Docker)
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pos-microservices.git
cd pos-microservices

2. Start MariaDB Locally

Create a database for each service:

CREATE DATABASE auth_db;
CREATE DATABASE product_db;
CREATE DATABASE order_db;
CREATE DATABASE customer_db;

3. Configure .yml

Each service has its own application.yml connecting to its respective database.

Example for product-service:

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/product_db
    username: root
    password:

4. Run Services

Start services one by one:

cd discovery-server
mvn spring-boot:run


Then start api-gateway, auth-service, product-service, order-service, customer-service.

🐳 Run Using Docker
Build JAR files
mvn clean package -DskipTests

Start containers
docker-compose up --build


All services will start automatically and register with Eureka.
